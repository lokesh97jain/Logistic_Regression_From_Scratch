# Logistic_Regression_From_Scratch


Determining sex of penguin with Logistic Regression

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of logistic regression from scratch for determining the sex of penguins. Logistic regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks, and in this project, we'll be applying it to predict the sex of penguins based on certain features.

Project Overview The goal of this project is to build a logistic regression model to predict the sex of penguins using a set of input features. We'll be implementing the logistic regression algorithm from scratch using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The dataset used for this project contains information about various penguins along with their sex and several features such as bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass.

Files and Folders Logistic_Regression_From_Scratch.ipynb: This is the main Jupyter Notebook containing the code implementation of logistic regression from scratch. It includes step-by-step explanations of the algorithm, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

data: This folder contains the dataset files required for the project.

penguins.csv: The CSV file containing the penguin dataset with features and sex labels. images: This folder stores any images used in the Jupyter Notebook for visualization purposes.

README.md: The readme file you are currently reading.
